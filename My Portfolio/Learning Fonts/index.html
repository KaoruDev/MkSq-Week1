	<h1>Hipsters</h1>
	<p id="harsh">By Harsh Patel</p>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>The term was coined during the jazz age, when "hip" emerged as an adjective to describe aficionados of the growing scene.[5] Although the adjective's exact origins are disputed, some say it was a derivative of "hop", a slang term for opium, while others believe it comes from the West African word "hipi", meaning "to open one's eyes".[5] Another argument suggests the term derives from the practice of laying on one's hip while smoking opium.[6] The ultimate meaning of "hip", attested as early as 1902, is "aware" or "in the know". Conversely, the antonym unhip connotes those who are unaware of their surroundings, also including those who are opposed to hipness.</p>

	<h2>What the Heck is a Hipster?</h2>
	<p>Nevertheless, "hip" eventually acquired the common English suffix -ster (as in spinster and gangster), and "hipster" entered the language.[5] The first dictionary to list the word is the short glossary "For Characters Who Don't Dig Jive Talk", which was included with Harry Gibson's 1944 album, Boogie Woogie In Blue. The entry for "hipsters" defined them as "characters who like hot jazz".[7] Initially, hipsters were usually middle-class white youths seeking to emulate the lifestyle of the largely black jazz musicians they followed.[5] In The Jazz Scene (1959), author Eric Hobsbawm (originally writing under the pen name Francis Newton) described hipster language—i.e., "jive-talk or hipster-talk"—as "an argot or cant designed to set the group apart from outsiders".</p>
